			"description": "It's time to work on your next challenge.\n\nThe [Postman API](https://learning.postman.com/docs/developer/intro-api/) lets you programmatically access data stored in your Postman account. This API requires an API key to tell the API server that a request it receives is from you and that you are allowed access to the data. Take a look at the documentation and browse the collection.\n\n1. **Add a request**: Fork the [Postman API collection](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-public-workspace/collection/12959542-c8142d51-e97c-46b6-bd77-52bb66712c9a?ctx=documentation) to your public workspace in the same way you forked today's challenge. Then find a request to get all of your collections. Duplicate it, and drag the copy over to this folder `Authorization`. Rename the request `All Collections - header`.\n1. **Add a header**: In the collection documentation, we see there are two ways to authorize this particular request. Let's start with adding an authorization header. Under the **Headers** tab, add a key `x-api-key` with the value <code>\\{{postman_api_key\\}}</code>. Hover over the variable to make sure Postman is reading in the correct value from an active environment. If the Postman API key is not already added to your environment, do that now. **Send** to make sure you receive a 200 status code, and then **Save** your changes.\n1. **Add a query parameter**: Duplicate the request, and rename the request `All Collections - query params`. In this new request, delete the header you added in the previous request. Again, following the instructions in the collection documentation for this particular API, go to the **Params** tab. Add a key `apikey` with a value <code>\\{{postman_api_key\\}}</code>. **Send** to make sure you receive a 200 status code, and then **Save** your changes.\n1. **Add an auth helper**: Instead of manually adding a header or params, let's use one of the authorization helpers provided by Postman. Duplicate the last request, and rename the request `All Collections - auth helper`. Delete the key-value pair under the **Params** tab. Under the **Authorization** tab, select `API key` type from the dropdown. Add `x-api-key` and <code>\\{{postman_api_key\\}}</code> to be added as a header. **Send** to make sure you receive a 200 status code, and then save your changes. Look under **Headers** to see the header that Postman auto-generated from the auth helper.\n1. **Add collection-level auth**: Since all of the requests in this collection require the same authorization method, let's add a collection-level authorization helper. For each of these three requests, delete the added header, delete the params, and update the Auth type to `Inherit auth from parent`. The parent of this request is the folder or collection that contains these requests. Select the collection `Authorization`, and add the `API key` auth helper under the `Authorization` tab like you did in the previous step. **Send** at least one of the requests to make sure you receive a 200 status code, and then save all of your changes.\n\nThere's a number of ways API servers can require authorization. Take a look at the other [auth helpers](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/authorization/) available in Postman.\n\nPostman can capture cookies for a browser or client application using the [Postman proxy](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/capturing-http-requests/) or [Postman Interceptor](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/interceptor/). You can't sync cookies with the Postman web app. Make sure you've installed the Postman desktop app. Take a look at the additional resources and try syncing cookies on your own.\n\nOnce you complete these steps, move on to the next folder in this collection to submit your solution. Follow the instructions in the request documentation."
